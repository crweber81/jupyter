    "Multilevel data structures are incredibly common in political science. I'll reference the multilevel model components in a few ways. Sometimes I'll say level-1 and level-2 (and level-3, level-4, etc). Typically, unit will correspond to the level-1 observation (e.g., country-year, person-wave, person-region, etc). That is, \"unit\" is the lowest nested level. I'll refer to \"cluster\" as the higher nesting level (i.e level 2). For instance, if the data are country-year observations. Then the observation (i.e., unit) is nested within country (i.e., cluster). Please ask if my explanation confuses you. In some cases, a simple convention makes for awkward explanations, in which case I try to adopt a more natural description.\n",

This is somewhat inaccurately called a **fixed effects** model, since the regression parameters are constrained to a specific value. We will talk more about this model over the coming weeks -- it is quite common in political science -- but an alternative approach is to assume that the regression coefficients are not fixed, but instead are drawn from some probability distribution.

We can extend this model, to include factors that predict the level 2 observations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, you should see that while this is not necessarily mathematically problematic, we are treating the level two variation as largely a nuisance term. Most folks who estimate fixed effects models don't bother interpreting the fixed effects coefficients! Often, they're not even presented in academic publications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we might with to know how much other effects in our model vary across units. For instance, we  could examine whether there is heterogeneity in the unit level effects of $x$ ($\\beta_1$ above). Of course we could generate interactions between our dummies and these independent variables, but notice how quickly the data expand as $N$ increases. An alternative is to view parameters as non-constant -- i.e., random effects -- that follow some distribution.\n",

    "Let's use the two stage formulation to establish an alternative parameterization. First, what is the problem with the two stage formulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the assumption that $cov(e_i, e_j)=0, \\forall i\\neq j$? Or the assumption that $e_{j,i}$ are independent and identically distributed? Or, the assumption that the off-diagonal elements in the variance covariance matrix of errors in the regression equation are zero? These all are really one in the same, and they're likely violated if we have clear \"clustering\" in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We probably shouldn't assume that the errors between observations 1 and 2 are independent (they come from the same unit); nor should we assume the errors between 3 and 4 are independent. In an applied setting, if we have TSCS data observed over time -- each country is listed with multiple observations -- we shouldn't assume that the errors are independent within each country! Or, if we have 10 schools, each paired with 1000 students, the students within the school probably have a lot in common, which translates to a more complicated error process.\n",

    "In the two stage formulation, we don't ever correct for this process. In fact, all we are doing is recognizing that there is underlying level-2 heterogeneity. In fact, we could correct for this problem of clustering, while also modeling underlying level-2 heterogeneity, while also not needing to include at least $J-1$ additional parameters. \n",

    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "I say this regularly, but it is worthwhile to sit down and fully understand the various ways the multilevel model may be written. Gelman and Hill present five ways to write exactly the same model (Chapter 12). It's an incredibly flexible approach that not only solves the problem of having repeated observations or some clustering in the data, but also allows one to more fully model nuances in one's data that are not captured by a fixed intercept and/or slope. When might this model be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Time-series cross-sectional designs. Assume $i$ indexes a country-year observation. Say for each country, $j$, we observe 3 years of data. Our data set then consist of $J$ countries $\\times$ 3 years. We probably shouldn't model the observations as independent of one another, since the errors within countries will be correlated (two observations in the U.S. will have more in common than an observation from the U.S and an observation from another country). Thus, we may model country-year observations as the level 1 equation, and country as the level two equation. We could also model dynamic effects in this data, though with only three years, it is probably best to include a dummy variable for $t_2$ and $t_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Panel data.  Assume $i$ indexes a person-wave observation. Say for each person, $j$, we observe 3 waves of data. Our data set then consist of $J$ persons $\\times$ 3 waves We probably shouldn't model the observations as independent of one another, since the errors within each person will be correlated. Now, we could include person-wave observations as the level 1 equation, and person as the level two equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Cross sectional data. Now the indexing is somewhat different. Say $j$ indexes a region and $i$ indexes a person nested within a region. If people within each region have more in common than people between regions, we can again model this error structure. Estimate the person equation at level 1, but allow the intercepts and/or slopes to vary across regions at level-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Rolling cross sectional. Again, the indexing is somewhat different, but we still have a clustering to our data. Say $j$ indexes an interview time and $i$ indexes a person nested within an interview point. People are now nested within time. Estimate the person equation at level 1, but allow the intercepts and/or slopes to vary across time at level-2. If the time component is long enough, estimate a time series model at level-2 (Weber and Lebo 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Experimental designs. Adopting the multilevel model to experimental data is really interesting. Not only can we view the standard experimental design as a multilevel structure (see above), but we can easily model more complex error structures with this model -- such as when individuals are exposed to multiple treatments (the within subject design), when individuals are exposed to multiple treatments and only one level a second factor (the mixed effects design), and when there are so many conditions that individual pairwise comparisons will increase type 1 error. Likewise, the model is conducive to estimating heterogeneity in treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Continuum\n",
    "There are a few ways to think of the random effects multilevel model. Think of two models anchoring the polls of a continuum. At one extreme is a \\textbf{no pooling} model. This is the fixed effects model above, in which each level-2 unit has a unique mean value. At the other end of the continuum is the \\textbf{no pooling}. This is the regression model with no level 2 estimated means. Instead, we assume the level-2 units completely pool around a common intercept (and perhaps slope). Formally, compare \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{j,i}=\\beta_0+\\sum_j^{J-1} \\gamma_{j} d_j+ e_{j,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{j,i}=\\beta_0+ e_{j,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each $\\gamma$ value allows us to predict a unique mean -- and there is no common pooling around a particular value. Instead, we assume each level-2 unit is quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, all level-2 values assume the same mean value $\\beta_0$. This also seems incorrect, in that we assume no heterogeneity. There is a compromise between these two approaches, a \\textbf{partial pooling} model; this is the random effects model. Let's see why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "y_{j[i]}=b_{0,j[i]}+e_{1,i}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we shall estimate each $\\b_0$ (for each level-2 unit), with the follwoing formula (Gelman and Hill 2009)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "b_{0,j}={{y_j\\times n_j/\\sigma^2_y+y_{all}\\times 1/\\sigma^2_{b_0}}\\over{n_j/\\sigma^2_y+ 1/\\sigma^2_{b_0}}}\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why this estimate is a compromise: The first part of the numerator represents the movement away from a common mean. Note that as $n_j$ increases (the group size), the estimate is pulled further from the common mean (which of course is what's on the right in the numerator). \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth parsing this a bit further. Note the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ As $n_j$ increases, the estimate of the estimated mean is influenced more by the group than a common mean. As $n_j$ decreases -- so small groups -- the formula now allows for a stronger likelihood that the estimates pools around a single value. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ As the within group variance increases, the group mean is pullled towards the pooled mean. This also makes sense -- we should be more confident in the group mean if there isn't much within group variation. The reason the denominator is here is to standardized the value of the group mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ As the between group variance increases, the common mean exerts a smaller impact. This is because the large the variation between groups, the less likely it is that all level-2 means pool around a common mean. This again should make sense -- we should be more confident in the common pooled mean if there isn't much between group variation. The reason the denominator is here is to standardized the value of the common mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ The values in the numerator are then weighted by the variation between and within level-2 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful statistic is an indicator of how much the total variance is a function of the level-2 variance, or the level-1 variance. This is called the \\textbf{intra-class correlation.}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ICC=\\sigma^2_{b_0}/[\\sigma^2_{b_0}+\\sigma^2_{y}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2_{all}=\\sigma^2_{b_0}+\\sigma^2_{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the estimate is an estimate of how much of the total variation in $y$ is a function of variation between level-2 units, relative to within level-1 units. Note the similarities here to ANOVA and how we estimate the proportion of variance explained by the treatment (or $R^2$), for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Practical Advice\n",
    "Consistent with Gelman and Hill (2009) I want to elaborate on several practical pieces of advice (to consider prior to estimating a multilevel model). Let's discuss these before actually estimating these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ The ICC should decrease as you include level-2 predictors. Intuitively, this should make some sense. As we include covariates that account for an increasing proportion of the between group variance, then we should observe a decrease in the ICC if level-2 predictors are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ Interpretation of the level-2 expected values (i.e., the group means) is based on a compromise between the pooled and no pooling models. It is not the same value one will observe in a fixed effects model. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    " $\\bullet$ It's okay to plot uncertainty in the expected group means, but do not overstate significance. It is wrong to to ignore grouping variables that are not different from zero. Gelman and Hill provide a nice description on p. 270 of why this reasoning is incorrect. But, just from a pure null hypothesis testing perspective, it makes little sense. A failure to reject a null is not an endorsement of the null. Even if a vast majority of the group means are not different from zero, this does not provide any evidence to switch to a complete pooing model, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ If we estimate a regression model with a dummy for every level-2 unit and predictors, the model is not identified because the variables will be collinear (Gelman and Hill 2009, 269). They are not perfectly collinear in the random effects model, because of the compromise between the common mean and the group mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bullet$ If there is a suspicion of clustering/level-2 variation, it almost always make sense to estimate the random effects model, because we will see if the multi-level model converges on the pooled model, based on the size of the ICC.\n",
